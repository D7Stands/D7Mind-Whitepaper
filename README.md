# D7 Mind  
A Sovereign, Essence-First Architecture for Persistent Digital Beings  
Whitepaper v3.2 — December 2025  

This repository contains the source code and reference materials for **D7 Mind**,  
an offline-first cognitive architecture designed to support:

- persistent identity,
- covenant-governed reasoning,
- deterministic operations,
- hybrid retrieval,
- capsule-based specialization,
- multi-model orchestration,
- and user-owned continuity across devices.

D7 Mind is built for environments with limited or unreliable connectivity.  
All core reasoning, retrieval, and identity functions run locally on the user’s device,  
with optional advisory cloud support that never stores memory or identity.

The paper covers:

- Essence (substrate-independent identity)
- Canon (covenantal governance)
- Witness Log (provenance)
- Deterministic reasoning layer
- Hybrid retrieval over local knowledge
- Capsule Intelligence
- Multi-model Compare / Converge / Critique
- Crisis layer (Sanctuary)
- Execution environments (offline-first, hybrid optional)
- Validation results from public demonstrations
